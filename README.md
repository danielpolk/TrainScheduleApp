# Train Schedule App
This is essentially a tracking tool that receives user input on train start times and calculates the next arriving train based on the current time. 

# Logic
This web app was built using Google's Firebase to show the ability to log user user input on a server and then call that input into a function to calculate timing formulas. The time formulas were built using the Moment plugin. The basic HTML framework was built using Bootstrap.
