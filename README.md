# Train Schedule App
This is essentially a tracking tool that receives user input on train start times and calculates the next arriving train based on the current time.

# Logic
This web app was built using Google's Firebase to show the ability to log user user input on a server and then call that input into a function to calculate timing formulas. The time formulas were built using the Moment plugin. The basic HTML framework was built using Bootstrap.

### Purpose and Usefulness
Let's say you just relocated to a new city where you don't know anybody. You want to meet new people and make connections that might lead to friendship, but we all know it can be hard to bridge the gap of stranger -> acquaintance -> friend. This is where FriendFinder comes in. It is a simple application where users can take a short survey about personality traits and interests that will help match them up with other FriendFinder users that answered the survey similarly.
